--> Carbon Foot Print:
	The amount of Green House Gases released into the atmosphere as a result of the activities of a particular individual, organization, or community.

* Green House Gases:
1. Carbon di Oxide (CO2)
2. Methane (CH4)
3. Nitrous Oxide (N20)
4. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
5. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
6. Sulphurhexafluoride (SF6) and Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)
	of which co2,ch4 and n2o are the major green house gases.

	The term "Carbon Foot Print" was popularised by a Oil Company BP (British Petroleum) to draw awareness of people 
towards individual responsibility for solving climate change.
	Exact Carbon Foot Print cannot be calculated because of inadequate knowledge of the complex processes and influence of natural processes in the emission of carbon gases.

--> Carbon Foot Print Calculator:
	These websites ask you to answer more or less detailed questions about your diet, transportation choices, home size, shopping and recreational activities, usage of electricity, heating, and heavy appliances such as dryers and refrigerators, and so on. The website then estimates your carbon footprint based on your answers to these questions.

* Direct Carbon Emission:
	Carbon emmited directly by the individual on the site of production.
Eg: Carbon emmited by the vehicle while driving.

* Indirect Carbon Emission:
	Carbon emmited indirectly, away from the site of production.
Eg: Carbon emmited during manufacturing and delivery of your vehicle.
